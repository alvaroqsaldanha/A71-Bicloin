# A71-Bicloin
A simulation of a bike rental service focused on reliability and replication, both front (client) and backend (servers) were developed with Java, using GRPC for communication. This is the solution submitted for a post-class challenge of the curricular unit Distributed Systems of the Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree @ IST. 

## Getting Started

The overall system is composed of multiple modules.

See the project statement for a full description of the domain and the system.

### Prerequisites

Java Developer Kit 11 is required running on Linux, Windows or Mac.
Maven 3 is also required.

To confirm that you have them installed, open a terminal and type:

```
javac -version

mvn -version
```

### Installing

To compile and install all modules:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

The integration tests are skipped because they require theservers to be running.

## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Build Tool and Dependency Management
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) - RPC framework


## Versioning
